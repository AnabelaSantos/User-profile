WE need to be aware that websites are read by people who need to change the font or text display properties to read the content. This includes people with low vision who use a bigger font, and people with dyslexia, reading, or other cognitive disabilities, who may have specific spacing requirements.
I tried to follow
the guidelines for accessibility for people with dyslexia in combination with the Web Accessibility Content Guidelines (WCAG).

1. Readable fonts:
   Used sans serif fonts, such as Arial and Comic Sans, as letters can appear less crowded
   Font size should be 12-14 point or equivalent (e.g. 1-1.2em / 16-19 px). Some dyslexic readers may request a larger font.
   Larger inter-letter / character spacing (sometimes called tracking) improves readability, ideally around 35% of the average letter width
   Inter-word spacing should be at least 3.5 times the inter-letter spacing.
   Some dyslexic people fine that larger line spacing improves readability. It should be proportional to inter-word spacing; 1.5/150% is preferable.
   Avoid underlining and italics as this can make the text appear to run together and cause crowding. Use bold for emphasis.
   Avoid using all capital letters and uppercase letters for continuous text. Lower case letters are easier to read.
2. Headings and structure
   Use headings and styles to create consistent structure to help people navigate through your content. In Word, you’ll find these tools in the ‘Home’ tab:

For headings, use a font size that is at least 20% larger than the normal text. If further emphasis is required, then use bold.
Use formatting tools for text alignment, justification, indents, lists, line and paragraph spacing to support assistive technology users. In Word, you’ll find these tools in the ‘Layout’ tab:
Add extra space around headings and between paragraphs.
Ensure hyperlinks look different from headings and normal text.
Colour
Use single colour backgrounds. Avoid background patterns or pictures and distracting surrounds.
Use sufficient contrast levels between background and text.
Use dark coloured text on a light (not white) background.
Avoid green and red/pink, as these colours are difficult for those who have colour vision deficiencies (colour blindness).
Consider alternatives to white backgrounds for paper, computer and visual aids such as whiteboards. White can appear too dazzling. Use cream or a soft pastel colour. Some dyslexic people will have their own colour preference.
Layout
Left align text, without justification. This makes it easier to find the start and finish of each line and ensures even spacing between words.
Avoid multiple columns (as used in newspapers).
Write short simple sentences: 60 to 70 characters is optimal.
Use white space to remove clutter near text and group related content.
Break up the text with regular section headings in long documents and include a table of contents.
Writing Style
Use active rather than passive voice.
Be concise; avoid using long, dense paragraphs.
Write in simple clear language using every day words.
Use images to support text. Flow charts are ideal for explaining procedures. Pictograms and graphics can help to locate and support
information in the text.
Consider using bullet points and numbering rather than continuous prose.
Give instructions clearly.
Avoid double negatives.
Avoid abbreviations where possible; always provide the expanded form when first used.
